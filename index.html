      <p>Hi! Getting started in software can be tricky. Here are a few things that can help.</p>

<p>Not all computers are good for development. A tablet probably isn't good enough. Get something with a disk (at least 75GB) and a keyboard. When shopping, keep in mind what parts you can replace. If the display is built in or can't take an alternate one, you had better make sure it's good enough for you.</p>

<p>It's important that the display, keyboard, and mouse are nice because that's what you see and touch all day.</p>

<p>Almost any computer made in the last decade has enough processing power. You don't have to worry about the jargon. If a device made in the last 5 years cost at least $1000 new, then it's fine for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>Used computers can be found on <a href="http://ebay.com">Ebay</a>
</li>
<li>Retailers often have refurbished laptops, like <a href="https://www.dellrefurbished.com/">Dell</a> and <a href="http://outlet.lenovo.com/">Lenovo</a>
</li>
<li>offer up websites or apps</li>

<ul>
<li>You can find scholarships at ...</li>
<li>mentorships -- is there a resource for this or should we save this for later?</li>
<li>internships
There are many coding bootcamps available that can help you acquire skills quickly. You can choose from an in-person boot camp that is soley online - no need to leave home.
There are a couple of bootcamps solely for women. <a href="https://hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a> in San Francisco and <a href="">Grace Hopper</a> in NYC but there are other programs closer to home. <a href="">The Iron Yard</a> has a campus in downtown Orlando as well as in <a href="">Tampa</a> or <a href="">University of Central Florida's Coding Boot Camp</a>. In addition there are several fully online programs such as <a href="">Bloc</a> and <a href="">Coding Dojo</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not ready for a that big a commitment of your time and money? There are lots of resources that allow you to tackle a single  </p>
