Hi! Getting started in software can be tricky. Here are a few things that can help.

# Equipment and tools

Not all computers are good for development. A tablet probably isn't good enough. You should have something with a disk (at least 75GB) and a keyboard. When shopping, keep in mind what parts you can swap in. If the display is built in or can't take an alternate one, you had better make sure it's good enough for you.

It's important that the display, keyboard, and mouse are nice because that's what you see and touch all day.

Almost any computer made in the last decade has enough processing power. You don't have to worry about the jargon. If a device made in the last 5 years cost at least $1000 new, then it's probably fine for you.

* Used computers can be found on [Ebay](http://ebay.com)
* Retailers often have refurbished laptops, like [Dell](https://www.dellrefurbished.com/) and [Lenovo](http://outlet.lenovo.com/)
* offer up  website https://offerupnow.com/search/?q=computer#offers
* letgo website https://us.letgo.com/en

Internet access can be expensive. If affording it is a problem, you may apply for federally-mandated low-income internet service. Some examples:

* from [AT&T](https://www.att.com/shop/internet/access/)
* [Brighthouse](http://brighthouse.com/35.html) has a $35/month plan

Several ISPs participate in a voluntary program, "Connect2Compete", to provide inexpensive internet access. It seems to be a ploy to placate monopoly regulators. They aren't sincere in offering it, but you should try to take advantage of it while it exists.

For Brighthouse areas, call +1-205-591-6880 (or perhaps +1-855-222-0102)
